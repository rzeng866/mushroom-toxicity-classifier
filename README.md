# mushroom-toxicity-classifier
This project uses supervised machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. Using the UCI Mushroom Dataset, I built and compared multiple classification models—including logistic regression, elastic net, decision tree, and random forest—to evaluate which approach best predicts toxicity.

## 📁 Files
- `Codebook.txt`: Describes all features
- `agaricus-lepiota.data`: UCI Mushroom Dataset
- `finalproject.Rmd`: Source R Markdown file used to generate the report
- `finalproject.html`: Rendered HTML report containing analysis results
-  Files ending in .rda: Saved results from models (to increase efficiency)

## 🔍 Summary
- Built classification models in R
- Evaluated performance using ROC AUC (area under curve)
- Compared model results to identify best fit
