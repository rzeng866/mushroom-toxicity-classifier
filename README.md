# mushroom-toxicity-classifier
This project uses supervised machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their physical characteristics. Using the UCI Mushroom Dataset, I built and compared multiple classification models—including logistic regression, elastic net, decision tree, and random forest—to evaluate which approach best predicts toxicity.
